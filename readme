CLO 5: Assess and implement compliance frameworks and security standards in organizations.

INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOME/S (ILO) OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISE
At the end of this activity, students should be able to:
1.	Explain the concept of Privacy by Design and its principles.
2.	Apply Privacy by Design principles in developing a simple web application.
3.	Demonstrate compliance with GDPR and Data Privacy Act requirements in application design.
4.	Draft a Privacy Policy aligned with international frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, RA 10173).
5.	Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented privacy controls in securing user data.
6.	Connect PbD principles to the Final Project system module design.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Privacy by Design (PbD) is a proactive approach to integrating privacy and data protection into the design and operation of IT systems, networked infrastructure, and business practices. The concept emphasizes that privacy should not be an afterthought but rather embedded into technology from the outset.
PbD is rooted in principles such as data minimization, informed consent, transparency, and accountability, which align with privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Philippine Data Privacy Act (RA 10173). This activity helps students gain practical experience by implementing these principles into a functioning web application.

This activity will allow students to apply PbD in a basic web application scenario while preparing them to implement similar design considerations in their Final Project ERD and module planning.

LABORATORY ACTIVITY 2
Activity Title: Implementing Privacy by Design in a Web Application
Time Allotment: 2.5 Hours
Materials/Resources:
•	Laptop/computer with internet access
•	Text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, Sublime, etc.)
•	Local web server (Apache, Nginx, or Node.js)
•	Sample web application template (provided by instructor or built by students)
Procedure:
1.	Form Groups (3–4 members).
2.	Introduction & Review (15 min):
o	Review Privacy by Design principles.
o	Discuss GDPR/Data Privacy Act requirements for web apps.
3.	Web Application Setup (15 min):
o	Use a basic template (e.g., HTML/PHP form or Django/Flask form).
o	Provide a simple web app (e.g., registration form).
o	Alternatively, create a basic form-based app that collects personal data.
4.	Privacy by Design Implementation (45 min):
Implement the following:
o	Data Minimization: Only request essential fields (name, email, phone). Avoid unnecessary fields (birthday, address if not required).
o	User Consent: Add a checkbox with link to Privacy Policy (must be checked before submission).
o	Data Encryption: Store sensitive data (e.g., password) using hashing + encryption.Identify appropriate encryption policy.
o	Access Controls: Add a simple authentication to restrict access.
o	Privacy Policy: Draft a privacy policy statement aligned with GDPR and RA 10173.
5.	Testing & Review (30 min):
o	Test the app for privacy compliance.
o	Peer/instructor review and feedback.
6.	Documentation (20 min):
•	Demonstration of Sample Output (15 min)
•	Show screenshot of working form with consent box.
•	Show database snippet where passwords are encrypted.
•	Attach a draft privacy policy document.

•	Shopify’s Data Protection Practices: https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy
•	Example of PbD in e-commerce (embedded consent & minimization).
1.	Write a report explaining implementation.
2.	Summarize challenges and solutions.
1.	Conclusion (10 min):
o	Instructor wraps up with key takeaways.
VI. Deliverables
1.	Screenshot of web form + consent mechanism.
2.	Screenshot of database showing hashed password.
3.	Privacy Policy draft (1–2 pages).
4.	Short reflection on how PbD aligns with Final Project modules (250 words).
